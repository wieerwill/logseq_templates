# LogSeq Templates
Using LogSeq and writing everything from scratch every time you want to add something? Lacking overview of topics and themes or searching for long time around your graph? Is your graph splattered and confusing?

Make your LogSeq clean and organized with some templates. Each template is a Markdown file itself and can be further modified by yourself to your liking.

- Person

**Upcoming Templates**:

- ... also adding some custom CSS and Styling

## How to use Templates?
Add the files in the pages folder into your logseq pages folder. That's all.

1. open any note or create a new page
2. write "/" and "Temp", auto completion should already suggest "Templates". Press it
3. Select which template you would like to use

Hint: Some prefer to have a single page with multiple templates in it, like multiple persons gathered. Others like to create a own page for each. Both is possible. Both can be utilized. 
With the Overview Pages and Tags, you will find everything very quickly.

## How to use Overview?
The Overview Pages query your pages and create nice overviews for each topic. Use those to navigate and gather your thoughts.
