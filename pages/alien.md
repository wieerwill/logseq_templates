	- ## Description
		- In the far reaches of space, the crew on board the ship "Nostromo" is 
		  returning to Earth until it receives a distress call, an alien one. 
		  However, the crew will soon take back with it the most terrifying 
		  creature in the universe: a Xenomorph, a killing machine that bleeds 
		  corrosive acid whenever anyone tries to hurt it. All alone in space, no 
		  one can hear them scream - trying to warn the rest of the galaxy of the 
		  terror that is the Xenomorph.
