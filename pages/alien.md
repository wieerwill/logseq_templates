- ## Description
	- In the far reaches of space, the crew on board the ship "Nostromo" is returning to Earth until it receives a distress call, an alien one. However, the crew will soon take back with it the most terrifying creature in the universe: a Xenomorph, a killing machine that bleeds   corrosive acid whenever anyone tries to hurt it. All alone in space, no one can hear them scream - trying to warn the rest of the galaxy of the terror that is the Xenomorph.
